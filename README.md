# VRoads

Just some testing with _Raylib_ and _OSM_
And maybe and MVP for a game/simulator

![wished outcome](./Docs/pics/WishedOutcome.png)

## Building the project:

 The _classic_ cmake stuff: (this is not needed using build.sh (see next section)
```c
    git clone <thisRepo>;
    git submodules update --init
    mkdir build; cd build;
    cmake ..
```

## Running the project:

Running this project, for now is kinda cringe, or not.

Use `build.sh`:
- `build.sh -er`, for executing the project after compiling the release mode( -O3)
- `build.sh -ed`, for executing the project after compiling the debug mode (more logs and stuff)
- `build.sh -gd`, for executing the project with GDB after compiling it in debug mode;

If the project runs successfully, a data.json will be created, it contains the data from the OSM queries.
Redownloading can be avoid by using environment variables. 

I usually run these parameters, __DISTANCE_FROM_CENTER (meters) is ignored if OFFLINE is set__

```shell
OFFLINE="data.json"  SCALE=".001" ROADWIDTH=".005" DISTANCE_FROM_CENTER="5000.0" ./build.sh -er
```


## Structure of the project:
```
    |_ src/   - The sourceCode
    |_ resources/ -  Textures and stuff (directory structure is ignored when compiling, there's just too few stuff for this to matter)
    |_ ./build.sh  -  Script for building, debugging, etc
    |_ external/ - git submodules
    |_ Docs/ - Idk, 
```
